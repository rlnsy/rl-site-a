<h2>Who am I?</h2>

Mostly, a guy who loves technology, science, literature and the outdoors.
I study Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vancouver,+BC">Vancouver, Canada</a> where I
just completed my third year.

I'm currently employed as an intern at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems">Cisco</a>,
developing and testing software to run on commercial-grade wireless devices.

<h2>What is this site?</h2>

You're looking at the barebones starter-template for the <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll">Hakyll</a> static site
generator, with a few tweaks I made for personalization. If I have the time, I plan on trying out some other tools
and possibly hooking up a blog engine, whose feed will be available below. Please poke around or even view the source
<a href="https://github.com/rlnsy/site-gen/tree/master/h">here</a>.
