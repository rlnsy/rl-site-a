Since I'm new to using pandoc, Hakyll, and static site generators in general,
I wanted to play around and see what kind of content I could produce
by simply generating posts in markdown. Let's take 'er for a spin shall we?

As you will have noticed above, placing emoji in the document works just fine
as I would have hoped. Using the Github-
style shortcuts (e.g. :hushed:) on the other hand, does not.

This is my first attempt at a code block:
```
print("Hello, world")
```
And... it looks like it worked!

How about some LaTeX?

$2 + 2 = 4$

Those are boring old numbers and we could easily have a false positive here.
Something a little more interesting:

$S(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^mr_{i}^2(\beta)$

Unfortunately that didnt work for me - and it's perfectly valid syntax.

Apparently I don't fully understand how markdown parsers work, because some
of the individual characters such as $\beta$ compile just fine.

I will be playing around with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) (the backend converter for Hakyll)
a little more to see how it deals with this kind of stuff.

Oh, and that was an example of a link!

That's it for now. For those interested the actual markdown that generated this post is [here](https://github.com/rlnsy/site-gen/blob/master/h/posts/2020-06-22-test.markdown).
